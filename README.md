### **Functionality Overview**

#### **How It Works**

1. **Grammar Definition**: Users define their custom language's syntax rules using CFG.
2. **Tokenization**: The lexer breaks down source code into tokens, categorizing elements like numbers, operators, and identifiers.
3. **Parsing**: The parser analyzes the sequence of tokens to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST).
4. **Semantic Analysis**: The AST undergoes semantic checks to ensure logical correctness and consistency.
5. **Code Generation**: The AST is transformed into optimized machine code using LLVM.
6. **Dynamic Error Handling**: QCC monitors code execution, catching exceptions and providing informative feedback.
7. **Profiling and Adaptation**: Performance data is collected to refine the coding experience based on user habits.
